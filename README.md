# Dual_Direction_Shooter
### A very short firefighter game with squares and circles, made with pygame.
---

This is one of my first projects on pygame that sort of does something midly interesting.
You're a square firefighter and fires appear randomly on the screen. You need to put them out.

### * How to use:

*Note: I haven't bundled this project, used **pipenv** or anything like that, but I plan to, I just don't understand it well enough yet.
For now, it requires you to install yourself the same environment I had when I wrote this code...*

**I used python 3.7 and pygame 1.9.4.**

* Install python => https://www.python.org/
* Install pygame => `pip install pygame` or `pip3 install pygame`
* Run the main script with python: `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

### * How to play:

* Use WASD keys to move and the arrow keys to use your hose on the fires
* Put out as many fires as you can. The game is over when:
  - You run out of water
  - There's more than 3 fire sources.
